# Random Item Chooser
 A GUI program made in Python that chooses an item at random.

I made a script in Python one night when I and my friend Raven went to play online, and we couldn't figure out what to do.
All the original script did was take an input of a number and choose a number between one and the provided integer. But
it could be better. I told Raven that I'd work on it more.

Now here is the finished, extremely over-engineered product of the Random Item Chooser. Enjoy.

For Windows users, you can download and use the EXE file without the need of installing Python. Or you can download
the source zip file and run the Python script.

For Linux users, just use the Python script. Python should be installed by default.

For Mac users, just deal with the fact I've never used MacOS in my life, so I have no idea how to build packages for it.
